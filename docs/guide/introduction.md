## What's Included?

AvelPress adapts the essence of Laravel's architecture for WordPress, offering the following essential components:

- **Database Layer:** Complete abstraction for database operations, simplifying queries and data manipulation.
- **Migrations:** Version control for your database schema, allowing you to evolve your structure safely.
- **Models:** Eloquent-style models for interacting with your WordPress data in an expressive way.
- **Controllers:** Clear separation of concerns to organize your business logic.
- **Service Providers:** Modular application bootstrapping, similar to Laravel.
- **Configurations:** Easy management of settings for different environments.
- **Routes:** Laravel-style routing for the WordPress REST API, defining endpoints cleanly.
- **Collections:** Expressive data manipulation tools, inspired by Laravel Collections.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** The `avel` CLI tool automates common development tasks, such as creating new projects (`avel new`), generating components (`avel make:controller`, `avel make:model`, `avel make:migration`), and creating production packages (`avel build`).

All these components are seamlessly integrated into the WordPress ecosystem, allowing you to build scalable and high-quality solutions with ease.
