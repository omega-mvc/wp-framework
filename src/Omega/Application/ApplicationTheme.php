/**
 * Theme application implementation for the Omega framework.
 *
 * This class represents a concrete application instance specifically designed
 * to bootstrap and manage a WordPress theme within the Omega framework.
 *
 * It extends the AbstractApplication class and inherits all core framework
 * responsibilities, including service container initialization, service provider
 * registration, routing setup, and dependency management.
 *
 * In addition to the base application behavior, this class enforces the
 * structural constraints required for WordPress themes, ensuring that the
 * provided base path contains a valid theme directory with a proper entry file
 * (typically style.css).
 *
 * The ApplicationTheme class acts as the bridge between the Omega framework
 * and the WordPress theme lifecycle, providing a structured and predictable
 * initialization flow for theme-based applications.
