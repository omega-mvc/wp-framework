 * Base service provider class.

 * Service providers are responsible for registering bindings, services, and
 * application components into the container, as well as bootstrapping logic
 * after all services have been registered.
 *
 * This class provides a structured way to organize application setup,
 * separating service registration from runtime initialization.
 *
 * It also includes helper methods for loading framework-specific resources
 * such as routes and database migrations.
