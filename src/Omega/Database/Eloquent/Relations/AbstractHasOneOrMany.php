 * AbstractHasOneOrMany
 *
 * Base implementation for one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
 *
 * This class extends AbstractRelation and provides the shared behavior
 * for relationships where the foreign key is stored on the related model
 * and points back to the parent model.
 *
 * It defines the core operations for managing related models:
 * - attaching existing models to a parent (save)
 * - creating new related records with automatic foreign key assignment
 * - deleting related records tied to a parent model
 *
 * This abstraction is used by both HasOne and HasMany relationships,
 * which differ only in cardinality, not in underlying behavior.
