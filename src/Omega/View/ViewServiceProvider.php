 * The registered instance can later be resolved through the container
 * or accessed through the corresponding facade, allowing templates
 * to be rendered from anywhere inside the application.
 *
 * The view service is shared as a singleton because the renderer
 * only needs access to the current application instance and does
 * not maintain per-request mutable state.
